# Ryan Parman

**Cloud-native engineering leader with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security for the modern web.**

As an engineering problem-solver with over 25 years of experience across technical leadership, software development, site reliability engineering, and cybersecurity, he understands how to listen, learn, adapt, and improve.

He was a founding member of the AWS SDK team; patented multifactor-authentication-as-a-service at WePay; helped define the CI, CD, and SRE disciplines at McGraw Hill; came up with the idea of “serverless, event-driven, responsive functions in the cloud” while at Amazon Web Services in 2010 (AWS Lambda); and much, much more.
